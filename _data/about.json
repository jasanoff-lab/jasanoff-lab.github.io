Techniques we are developing and applying in our lab offer unique capability for making this connection, because they enable signaling processes to be measured in deep brain tissue, over wide regions of the brain, in live animals of any size. Some of the questions we are most interested in include:",

Some of our tools are compatible with other imaging techniques as well. Our laboratory has achieved a number of important milestones, which we seek to exploit and build upon. Some examples include:",
