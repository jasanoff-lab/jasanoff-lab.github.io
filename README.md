# jasanoff-lab

This github repository contains the Jasanoff Lab website.

## Editing content

Site content is in the `_data/` directory. In this directory, there is one `json` file per page of the site. For more information about the `json` format, see [this resource](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-json) or search for more examples online.

Find the `json` file corresponding to the page you want to edit. For example, `about.json`. Edit this file to edit the text that will appear on the website.

1. In the directory structure, at the top of the page, click on `_data`
2. Click on the `json` file
3. Click the pencil in the top right of the file preview to edit.
4. When finished editing, scroll to the bottom and click "commit changes"
